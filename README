= SNMP Library for Ruby

== Summary

This library implements SNMP (the Simple Network Management Protocol).  It is
implemented in pure Ruby, so there are no dependencies on external libraries
like net-snmp[http://www.net-snmp.org/].  You can run this library anywhere
that Ruby can run.

See snmplib.rubyforge.org[http://snmplib.rubyforge.org/] for more info.

Version 0.6.0 of this software supports the following:

* The GetRequest, GetNextRequest, GetBulkRequest, SetRequest, Response
  SNMPv1_Trap, SNMPv2_Trap, and Inform PDUs
* All of the ASN.1 data types defined by SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c
* Sending informs and v1 and v2 traps
* Trap handling for v1 and v2 traps
* Symbolic OID values (ie. "ifTable" instead of "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2") as   
  parameters to the SNMP.Manager API
* Includes symbol data files for all current IETF MIBs 

See the SNMP.Manager, SNMP.TrapListener, and SNMP.MIB classes and the
examples below for more details.

== Changes

Changes for version 0.6.0:

* Added support for sending informs and traps for SNMPv2c and traps for
  SNMPv1
* Improved SNMP::Manager#walk so that it can handle missing varbinds
  when reading tables.  The indexes for a table row read by #walk are now
  guaranteed to match. 
* Added to_oid methods to SNMP::OctetString, SNMP::Integer, and
  SNMP::IpAddress (feature request #2486)
* Fixed some problems with retrying requests that caused annoying "Request ID
  mismatch" warnings and caused too few retries to be attempted
* Thanks to Mark Cotner, Dan Hamlin, Tim Howe, Diana Eichert, Ery Lee,
  Jan Åge Johnsen, and Jeff Foster for their help and suggestions (and
  apologies in advance if I have forgotten someone).

Changes for version 0.5.1:

* Fixed bugs #2054 and #2164.  Responses were ignored if they did
  not come back from the same host that the request was sent to.  This
  behavior causes problems for some multi-homed hosts.
* Fixed bugs #1679 (NameError in Manager.get_response()) and #1736 
  (Notifications not included in YAML output).
* Added Manager.get_value convenience method to get a list of values for a 
  list of OIDs instead of the full VarBindList list like Manager.get.
* Added vb_list alias for PDU.varbind_list.
* Changed how Manager.walk yields to it's block.  It is now more consistent 
  about yielding a list if a list is provided as an argument.
* Break out of Manager.walk instead of looping forever if OIDs returned by the 
  remote host are not in ascending order.

Changes for version 0.4.0:

* Added support for loading MIBs and using symbolic OID values.
* Enhanced Manager.walk
    * It can now take an OID list as a parameter.  (Thanks to Simon
      Barnes for the suggestion.)
    * Takes a block instead of returning a list to allow incremental
      processing of results.
* Some minor improvements to code structure and error messages.

Changes for version 0.3.0:

* Added SNMPv1_Trap and SNMPv2_Trap classes
* Added TrapListener class for receiving v1 and v2 traps
* Added Manager.walk
* Fixed a problem with IpAddress encoding
* Defined IpAddress.== and IpAddress.eql? so that IpAddress objects can be
  compared by value

Changes for version 0.2.0:

* Added GetBulkRequest
* Added open and close methods to the Manager class to ensure that
  sockets can be properly released.
* Made SNMP::OctetString and SNMP::Integer behave more like Ruby's String and 
  Fixnum
* Fixed a problem with encoding/decoding the object id "0.0"

== Installation

You can use RubyGems [http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems] to
install the latest version of the SNMP library remotely.

  gem install --remote snmp

The SNMP Library can be downloaded from
RubyForge[http://rubyforge.org/projects/snmplib/] in several different
formats.

From the .gem file you can install using
RubyGems[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems].

  gem install snmp-0.5.0.gem

From the .tgz or .zip file you can install using
setup.rb[http://i.loveruby.net/en/prog/setup.html].  Uncompress the archive
and then run setup.

  cd snmp-0.5.0
  ruby setup.rb (may require root privilege)  

== Testing

This library has received limited testing:
* The unit tests have been executed with Ruby 1.8.3 on Mac OS X 10.4.
* Basic interoperability testing has been done with the
  net-snmp[http://www.net-snmp.org/] tools.

I'm very interested in hearing about successes or failures on other platforms.

== Examples

=== Get Request

Retrieve a system description.

  require 'snmp'
  
  SNMP::Manager.open(:Host => 'localhost') do |manager|
      response = manager.get(["sysDescr.0", "sysName.0"])
      response.each_varbind do |vb|
          puts "#{vb.name.to_s}  #{vb.value.to_s}  #{vb.value.asn1_type}"
      end
  end

=== Set Request

Create a varbind for setting the system name.

  require 'snmp'
  include SNMP

  manager = Manager.new(:Host => 'localhost')
  varbind = VarBind.new("1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0", OctetString.new("My System Name"))
  manager.set(varbind)
  manager.close

=== Table Walk

Walk the ifTable.

  require 'snmp'

  ifTable_columns = ["ifIndex", "ifDescr", "ifInOctets", "ifOutOctets"]
  SNMP::Manager.open(:Host => 'localhost') do |manager|
      manager.walk(ifTable_columns) do |row|
          row.each { |vb| print "\t#{vb.value}" }
          puts
      end
  end

=== Get-Next Request

A more difficult way to walk the ifTable.
 
  require 'snmp'
  include SNMP

  Manager.open(:Host => 'localhost') do |manager|
      ifTable = ObjectId.new("1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2")
      next_oid = ifTable
      while next_oid.subtree_of?(ifTable)
          response = manager.get_next(next_oid)
          varbind = response.varbind_list.first
          next_oid = varbind.name
          puts varbind.to_s
      end
  end

=== Get-Bulk Request

Get interface description and admin status for 10 rows of the ifTable.

  require 'snmp'
  include SNMP

  ifDescr_OID = ObjectId.new("1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2")
  ifAdminStatus_OID = ObjectId.new("1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7")
  MAX_ROWS = 10
  Manager.open(:Host => 'localhost') do |manager|
      response = manager.get_bulk(0, MAX_ROWS, [ifDescr_OID, ifAdminStatus_OID])
      list = response.varbind_list
      until list.empty?
          ifDescr = list.shift
          ifAdminStatus = list.shift
          puts "#{ifDescr.value}    #{ifAdminStatus.value}"
      end
  end

=== Trap Handling

Log traps to STDOUT.

  require 'snmp'
  require 'logger'

  log = Logger.new(STDOUT)
  m = SNMP::TrapListener.new do |manager|
      manager.on_trap_default do |trap|
          log.info trap.inspect
      end
  end
  m.join
